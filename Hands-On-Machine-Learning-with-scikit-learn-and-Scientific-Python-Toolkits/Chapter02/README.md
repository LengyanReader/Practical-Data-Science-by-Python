# Chapter 2: Making Decisions with Trees

In this chapter, we are going to start by looking at our first supervised learning algorithm - decision trees.
The decision tree algorithm is versatile and easy to understand.
It is widely used and also serves as the building block for numerous advanced algorithms,
such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees.
By the end of this chapter, you will have a very good understanding of the following topics:

- How do decision trees learn?
- Getting more reliable scores.
- Tuning the hyper-parameters for higher accuracy.
- Visualizing the tree's decision boundaries.
- Using decision trees for regression.

Since this is the first chapter where we use a supervised learning algorithm here,
we will also discuss how to split your data, and how to evaluate your model's performance.
